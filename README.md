# Hi there 👋 I'm Jason

I'm a full-stack software engineer based in Wellington, New Zealand. Here's a little bit about me: 

- ✨ Created [Constellation](https://github.com/constellation-load-testing/constellation-local), a framework for scalable and accessible geo-distributed API load testing
- 👷 Former Civil Engineer focused on desining earth stabilizing structures and mitigating against pesky earthquakes ⚡
- 🐾 I live with two australian farm dogs, Biscuit and Coco. They're very cute, but they bark.. A LOT.
